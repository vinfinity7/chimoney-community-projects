## Introduction

Join us for a month of coding, learning, and contributing to Chimoney's open-source projects!

## Prerequisites

To contribute to the projects/issues, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of programming languages (e.g. Python, JavaScript).
- Familiarity with version control systems like Git.
- Technical Writing skills (Optional)


## Resources

Here are some helpful resources to get you started:

- **API Documentation:** Explore Chimoney's API documentation. You can find detailed information [here](https://chimoney.readme.io/reference/introduction).
  

## Obtaining API Keys

1. **Sign up for a Chimoney Developer Account:** See the Sandbox Access Instruction [here](https://sandbox.chimoney.io/developers). If you don't already have one, you'll need to sign up for a Chimoney developer account sandbox access at [sandbox.chimoney.io](https://chimoney.readme.io/reference/sandbox-environment).

- You can also check out this article on how to obtain API keys [here](https://community-chimoney.hashnode.dev/getting-started-with-chimoneys-api-chiconnect).

2. **Create a New Application:** Once logged in, navigate to your developer dashboard and create a new application. This will generate your API key for you.

5. **Start Contributing:** With your API keys in place, you're ready to start contributing!
